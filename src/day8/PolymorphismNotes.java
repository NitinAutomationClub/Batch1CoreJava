	 * 1. Poly- Many , Morphism-forms
	 * 2. one can perform many things
	 * 3. Shapes : Triangle , Circle , Square 
	 * Water : Liquid , Solid

	 * How we can achieve 
	 * 1. Method Overloading
	 * 2. Method Overriding
	 * 
	 * Method OverLoading -Static Polymorphism or early binding
	 * handle by compiler
	 * 
	 * Method Overriding : Dynamic Polymorphism or late binding 
	 * Handle by JVM
	 * 
	 * Method OverLoading Rules : 
	 * 1. Method name should be same
	 * 2. Same method should be in same class
	 * 3. Different Arguments
	 *    a. No. of argument 
	 *    b. Sequence of argument
	 *    c. Type of Argument
